							<font size="8"> <div> Starry Night (1889) </div> </font> <br />
						</div>
						<div> One of Van Gogh's most famous and recognizable paintings, Starry Night was created during his stay at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Remy-de-Provence. The painting depicts a swirling night sky filled with bright, glowing stars over a peaceful village, with a dark cypress tree in the foreground. This masterpiece, now housed at The Museum of Modern Art in New York, captures Van Gogh's emotional turmoil and fascination with the night. His expressive brushstrokes and intense color contrast make Starry Night a symbol of both turbulence and hope, showcasing his unique ability to transform inner emotions into visual poetry. </div>

							<font size="8"> <div> Sunflower (1888) </div> </font> <br />
						</div>
						<div> Van Gogh's Sunflowers series is one of his most well-loved and widely recognized works. Created in Arles, France, these paintings feature bright yellow sunflowers in a simple vase, exuding warmth and vibrancy. Van Gogh painted them as decorations for his home, intending to impress fellow artist Paul Gauguin. The paintings symbolize gratitude and happiness, and they reflect Van Gogh's deep appreciation for nature. Today, different versions of Sunflowers are housed in various museums, including The National Gallery in London and the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. </div>

							<br />
							<font size="8"> <div> The Bedroom (1888) </div> </font> <br />
						</div>
						<div> Depicting his modest room in Arles, The Bedroom is a deeply personal painting that conveys Van Gogh’s longing for peace and stability. With bold colors and slightly distorted perspective, the painting creates a dreamlike atmosphere, reflecting his emotional state at the time. The bright blue walls, wooden furniture, and simple bed contribute to a sense of comfort, yet there is also an underlying feeling of isolation. The Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam now houses this artwork, which remains one of his most intimate and expressive pieces. </div>

							<font size="8"> <div> Wheat Field with Cypresses (1889) </div> </font> <br />
						</div>
						<div> During his stay at the asylum in Saint-Rémy, Van Gogh found solace in painting nature. Wheat Field with Cypresses is a vibrant landscape featuring golden wheat fields, deep green cypress trees, and a swirling blue sky. The painting, currently displayed at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, showcases Van Gogh’s dynamic brushwork and love for the countryside. His use of color and movement captures the energy of nature, making the painting both lively and calming. </div>

							<br />
							<font size="8"> <div> Almond Bloosom (1890) </div> </font> <br />
						</div>
						<div> Unlike many of his paintings that depict emotional intensity, Almond Blossom is a serene and delicate work. Created as a gift for his newborn nephew, the painting features white blossoms against a bright blue sky, symbolizing new life and hope. Influenced by Japanese art, Van Gogh used clean lines and a flat perspective to give the painting a unique style. Now displayed at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, Almond Blossom remains a symbol of renewal and optimism. </div>

							<br />
							<font size="8"> <div> The Potato Eaters (1885) </div> </font> <br />
						</div>
						<div> One of Van Gogh’s earliest masterpieces, The Potato Eaters depicts a poor peasant family gathered around a dimly lit table, sharing a simple meal. Painted in dark, earthy tones, the work reflects Van Gogh’s desire to portray the harsh realities of rural life. He deliberately used rough brushstrokes and an unpolished style to highlight the rawness of his subject. This painting, housed at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, stands as a powerful testament to his early artistic vision and social awareness. </div>

							</a>
							<br />
							<font size="8"> <div> Irises (1889) </div> </font> <br />
						</div>
						<div> While living at the asylum in Saint-Rémy, Van Gogh painted Irises, a vibrant and expressive floral piece. Using bold blues, greens, and purples, he captured the natural beauty of the irises with dynamic brushstrokes. Created as a form of therapy, the painting conveys a sense of movement and energy. Today, Irises is part of the collection at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, where it continues to inspire viewers with its striking composition and emotional depth. </div>

							<font size="8"> <div> The Night Cafe (1888) </div> </font> <br />
						</div>
						<div> Van Gogh’s The Night Café is an intense and unsettling painting that depicts the interior of a dimly lit café in Arles. Using deep reds, yellows, and greens, he aimed to create a sense of unease, describing the café as a place where one could "go mad." The exaggerated perspective and harsh lighting contribute to the painting’s claustrophobic feel. Now housed at Yale University Art Gallery.</div>
